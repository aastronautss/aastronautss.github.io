      What do you get when you cross a photographer, a philosophy nerd, a science lover, a voracious reader, an almost-adequate writer, and a software engineer? You'd probably get someone like me. I have a BA in philosophy from the University of California, Santa Cruz, and two years of experience building web applications and managing technology stacks.

    <p>
      I am currently working as a software engineer at a mid-level startup in San Francisco, where I develop and maintain a large logistics platform based on Ruby on Rails.

    <h3>Technical Interests</h3>

    <p>
      My primary tools are Ruby and Rails, but I consider myself stack-agnostic. I am proficient with Ruby, JavaScript, Python, SQL, HTTP, and REST, and have built projects with frameworks like Rails, Sinatra, Flask, React, and Backbone. I like robust test suites and elegant design, and I value clean, extensible code. I take ownership and pride in the projects in which I'm involved.
