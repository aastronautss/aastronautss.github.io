      What do you get when you cross a photographer, a philosophy nerd, a science lover, an almost-adequate writer, and a software engineer? You'd probably get someone like me. I have a BA in philosophy from the University of California, Santa Cruz, and four years of experience building web applications and managing technology stacks.

    <p>
      I am currently working as a software engineer at a mid-level startup in San Francisco, where I build and maintain a large e-commerce and logistics platform based on Ruby on Rails.

    <h3>Technical Interests</h3>

    <p>
      My primary tools are Ruby and Rails, but I consider myself stack-agnostic. I am proficient with Ruby, JavaScript, Python, SQL, and Docker, and have built projects with frameworks like Rails, Sinatra, Flask, Vue, React, and Backbone. I like robust test suites and elegant design, and I value clean, extensible code. I take ownership and pride in the projects in which I'm involved.
