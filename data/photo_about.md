I have been making photographs for ten years, give or take a few. I used to like to call myself a [street photographer](https://www.flickr.com/photos/linkie0/albums/72157605368287619), but in recent years my focus has shifted primarily toward [landscapes](https://www.flickr.com/photos/linkie0/albums/72157620539278413). I attended Rochester Institute of Technology for two years as a photojournalism student before deciding it wasn't my thing, but the experience I gained there has been very important to me.

I will gladly shoot your wedding. Feel free to [reach out to me](/photo/contact) and we can discuss the terms.
