Between the hours of 9am to 5pm on weekdays I write software for [Gusto](https://gusto.com), a company specializing in solving problems for small and medium businesses. I like to write in Ruby and Typescript, and am a proponent of expressive, well-tested object-oriented architecture. I've helped build close-knit, collaborative teams that deliver high-quality, performant, and maintainable applications.

Previously, I worked for [Test Double](https://testdouble.com), a consulting agency bent on improving the way the world writes software; and [Touch of Modern](https://touchofmodern.com), a company with a robust, home-built e-commerce platform.

You may [get in touch with me](/contact) if you'd like a resume or any more information about this part of my life.
