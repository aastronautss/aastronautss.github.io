<p>
  Between the hours of 9am to 5pm on weekdays I write software for
  <a href="https://gusto.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    Gusto</a
  >, a company specializing in solving problems for small and medium businesses.
  I like to write in Ruby and Typescript, and am a proponent of expressive,
  well-tested object-oriented architecture. I've helped build close-knit,
  collaborative teams that deliver high-quality, performant, and maintainable
  applications.

  Previously, I worked for
  <a href="https://testdouble.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    Test Double</a
  >, a consulting agency bent on improving the way the world writes software;
  and
  <a href="https://touchofmodern.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    Touch of Modern</a
  >, a company with a robust, home-built e-commerce platform. You may
  <a href="/about">get in touch with me</a> if you'd like a resume or any more
  information about this part of my life.
