{:toc}

I double-dog dare you to have discussion about the nature of reality without saying the word "Matrix." I bet that you, like any self-respecting modern mind, have toiled with the idea that the world around you---including your own body---might not actually be composed of the atoms you were taught about in high school. Instead, the quarks and leptons that buzz around space and time are nothing but bits that buzz around the logic gates in a computer existing in the *actual* universe. The simulation can be paused, rewound, and slowed down---the computer can be shut off and destroyed---without your consent or your knowledge of it happening. How would knowing this affect you? Do your values shift accordingly? Would you treat yourself or others[^people] any differently if you believed that you are merely a component of a simulated reality?

To boil that down to a question, we might ask this: How does my knowledge of the nature of my being[^being] affect my values? Put more directly: Would I care if I knew I was in a simulation?

There are a lot of vague terms in the above remarks, but hopefully we can parse it out a little, for the sake of provoking an interesting discussion. The questions we stated are open-ended. Everybody has a different answer to them, because (in a nutshell) we derive our values from different kinds of things. With that in mind, I'm hoping here to not only deliver my take on those questions, but also to explore other pathways, and perhaps think of a more general-case answer.

## [1] Theories of Constitution

First, we should touch on a related question: *How are my values affected by what I think I am made of?* Again, everybody has a different response to this, but let's try to avoid descending into relativism for now.

The phrase "what I think I am made of" refers my (or yours or whoever's) personal theory of what makes up "me" and the rest of the world. From here I'll refer it to as a "theory of constitution."[^constitution] We can come up all sorts of examples of this, no two being mutually exclusive by their own form. You could be a monist, a dualist, or a pluralist, or something else. You could think we live in a hologram, or you could think we live in the Matrix, or you could think we really are made of particles buzzing around in the void. You could suspect that your 'mind' is somehow separate from the rest of the world, or you could find such an idea too perplexing to be true.

### You Poor Soul

We've seen lots of thinkers try to derive a system of values (ethics or otherwise) from first principles such as their theory of constitution, and I can think of different ways in which this can be done. For instance, we might see ourselves as the handiwork of a divine force, and thus we might want to determine what to do with our lives accordingly. In cases like this, the relation between our values and our theories of constitution are very intimately tied, especially if we want to believe in the immortality of the soul (mind, self, psyche, whatever). This is because this variety of theory of constitution (we'll henceforth abbreviate this as ""ToC", or ""ToCs" for the plural form) involves an identity that is literally a persistent object which you can nurture or mistreat. The knowledge that we are[^have-or-are] "soul stuff" seems to more readily tie our values to the substance in a way that those values would change dramatically depending on the substance in question.

This might be a part of why we get the sort of argument where the dualist[^dualist] expresses bafflement over how a non-dualist (or to put it more specifically, someone who doesn't believe in the immortality of the soul) could possibly determine right from wrong, or have a code of ethics whatsoever. To the dualist's credit, it does seem odd to claim that we're here merely because genes kept finding clever ways to prolong themselves--that is, if you're used to the idea of a more purposeful existence. Take the soul-believer's aptness to intimately tie ethics to metaphysics and apply it to a soul-less world. What's left, even before we talk about teleology? The foundation bottoms out very easily. In spite of this, later on we'll dive in to this notion and see where it gets us.

First, though, I want to try and explain what I find unsatisfactory about the dualist's position. I could go on about the same sorts of complaints you'll hear in an intro philosophy course, but I'll try to approach it in a way that feels more relevant to this discussion. My main issue with the dualist comes not from a discomfort with talk about substances and souls, but rather from an epistemological approach: the idea that people can get along (and have gotten along) with finding value without even being aware of such a position.[^prehistoric] This idea will show up a lot as we go along, but I want to take a good look at it under the lens of what I see as one of the most basic value-metaphysics linkages that exists.

Take as given that there does indeed exist a soul tied to every human body, and that soul is immortal and a product of divine creation. This world would be the same as ours,[^soul-world] except the dualists were right. There would conceivably still exist those who disagree with the dualists, just as there exist people in our own world who disagree on similar matters. Could it not be as well that those people can get along thinking they're deriving their values through their respective means of value derivation?

I suppose one possible response to this might be the metaphysician's typical parlor trick of claiming that while a person thinks they are uttering words that refer to one thing, while in reality those words refer to something entirely different. The non-soul-believers in this world think they're perfectly well-off finding their values from, e.g., their high school history teacher's rants, you'll really find the existence of a divinely-conceived, immortal soul if you dig just a little deeper. From there it simply transforms into a quest to find the logical connection between the two. A paper is published, a response is published soon after, and the cycle of scholarly mud slinging goes on.

An important distinction to be made here is that (I hope) my argument is indifferent to whether or not there is an answer to the question of where we get our values from. I'd like to say I don't have a horse in that race. My position favors a discussion about beliefs, and whether those beliefs are vindicated or simply bad makes no difference. That makes this whole project seem much less philosophically interesting, but bear with me.

### In Which Tyler Tries to Do Logic[^logic-literature]

Since one of my major claims is that my position is more epistemically motivated, it might be beneficial to further discuss what I mean by that. The questions I am exploring are centered around the idea of discovery. When something is discovered, we take on new beliefs, and see our old beliefs in new light. For the sake of simplicity, call a person's beliefs a set of propositions that they hold to be true. You might picture it like this: if person 1 believes propositions $$ a $$, $$ b $$, $$ c $$, and $$ d $$ are true, their beliefs an take the form $$ \{ a, b, c, d \} $$, and all other propositions that can be inferred by entailment. The complement of this set are the propositions person 1 thinks are not true. Person 2's set of beliefs might be $$ \{ a, c, e, f \} $$. Person 1 and person 2 disagree on matters of $$ b $$, $$ d $$, $$ e $$, and $$ f $$. Of course, this is much more messy in the real world, but it'll do for this illustration.

We can imagine new information being presented that shifts a person's beliefs--say, for example, that person now believes $$ f $$ rather than $$ a $$ (perhaps they're mutually exclusive). Theseus aside,[^theseus] can't we still consider the person with these beliefs to be the same person?[^mutating-caller] We all have our own pet theories of identity of this sort, but what matters is how this affects the belief-holder. Perhaps, though, we classify a specific kind of belief. Since we're targeting beliefs related to ToCs, we'll denote such propositions with a $$ ^{*} $$. *I am[^have-soul] a soul* can be denoted as $$ s^{*} $$, for instance. Say person 1 has belief $$ s^{*} $$, then. What characteristics do these special propositions have? More importantly (and more to the point), can we swap those propositions out in a person's belief-set with others with minimal consequences?

Even further, how would beliefs about values (which I suppose could take the form of "I ought to $$ x $$," or something similar) be affected by such a shift? We'll denote such beliefs with a hat. For example, $$ \hat{x} $$ would translate to "I ought to $$ x $$," or "$$ x $$ is good," or "I like $$ x $$."

I think a good way to imagine how shifting beliefs can affect others is to take into account a person's *reasons for believing* a proposition.[^first-order-logic] For that we'll use an implication symbol $$ \Rightarrow $$, and define it like this: a set of beliefs $$ B $$ can be said to be the reasons for believing proposition $$ p $$ if and only if $$ B \Rightarrow p $$. The truth conditions for this are a lot like entailment,[^entailment] where $$ B $$ is a sufficient condition for $$ p $$. In English, we might simply say the members of $$ B $$ are our reasons for believing $$ p $$.

An interesting question in this regard might be whether or not this construct works *exactly* like entailment. That is, is $$ p $$ a necessary condition for $$ B $$? This is up for debate, we'll take it as granted for now. I like to think this is fairly easy to swallow, since we aren't concerned about the actual rules of entailment, so $$ p $$ doesn't have to logically follow from $$ B $$, be it by form or by meaning.

With all this in place, we can start to imagine some different scenarios that can take this form. The members of $$ B $$ all have their own sets of propositions which entail them. $$ p $$ could be the single member of $$ B $$, or $$ B $$ could be the empty set $$ \emptyset $$.[^empty-set] $$ B $$ can be talked about in lots of ways. It might simply be how we rationalize our belief in $$ p $$. If we're Vulcans, we can see this system of entailments exactly mimicking first-order logic. If we're omniscient, we might see a one-to-one mapping of all beliefs with the real world. $$ B $$ can entail more than just $$ p $$, too. For one person, $$ B $$ might entail $$ p $$, while for another $$ B $$ might entail $$ q $$.

Suppose, now, that we have a person $$ \alpha $$ (we'll use Greek letters for people) for whom $$ s^{*} \in B _{\alpha} $$[^member-of] and $$ B _{\alpha} \Rightarrow \hat{x} $$. This illustrates a person who has a ToC as a reason for having a given value. We also have another person $$ \beta $$ for whom $$ s^{*} \notin B _{\beta} $$ but nonetheless $$ B _{\beta} \Rightarrow \hat{x} $$. Take it even further, and we might say $$ \neg s^{*} \in B _{\beta} $$.[^negation] Fair enough---we can conceive of a way of generating a modal logic for scenarios like this, where a "world" denotes a single person's beliefs. There's lots of literature on modal systems, and maybe there exists one that works well with our illustration. However, what does $$ \alpha $$ do when he no longer believes $$ s^{*} $$? The set $$ B - \{ s^{*} \} $$[^set_minus] no longer entails $$ \hat{x} $$, at least at first blush.

I suspect that $$ \alpha $$ has two options. The first would be to carefully consider a belief which takes the place of $$ B - \{ s^{*} \} $$. For this to happen, it would help to understand the web of entailments which brought $$ s^{*} $$ about in the first place. If for $$ \alpha $$ we had $$ \emptyset \Rightarrow s^{*} $$, it would be easier than if we had $$ S \Rightarrow s^{*} $$ for some messy $$ S $$. The second would be to reject $$ \hat{x} $$ and use $$ B - \{ s^{*} \} $$ as a starting point to adopt a new value, call it $$ \hat{y} $$, if $$ \alpha $$ feels the need to adopt a new value at all.

Perhaps, though, $$ \alpha $$ still holds $$ \hat{x} $$. This could mean a few things, and I'll try to go into a little detail about one of them here. In normal logic, what would happen if we hold that $$ A $$ entails $$ p $$ (which we'll use $$ \models $$ for entailment in 'normal' logic), but find that a member of $$ A $$ is false? Since if $$ A \models p $$ and $$ A $$ is false, then we must say that $$ p $$ is false. If we still hold that $$ p $$ is true, then we need to examine the rules of inference we used to derive $$ p $$ from $$ A $$.[^rules-of-inference] With our system, we'd need to do something similar if we still want to hold that $$ \hat{x} $$ is true in spite of our rejection of $$ s^{*} $$. How did $$ \alpha $$ come to think that $$ \hat{x} $$ follows from $$ B $$ in the first place, and what changed in this inference when we rejected $$ s^{*} $$?

This would call for an examination of how we come to believe things---the reasons for the reasons for believing. Wouldn't these reasons themselves qualify as beliefs? For example, rhetoric or authority might mean more to a person than logical inference, and for another it would be the other way around. Maybe $$ \alpha $$ at some point decided authority meant less to him than emotional desires, or something else. We'll discuss gradations in value judgments in the next section, but for now it isn't difficult to imagine what this looks like. As we come to discover new ways of reasoning, we change the rules of inference through which we judge things as reasons for believing other things.

Perhaps I am a little too far out at sea here, but since the purpose of this piece is to discuss how beliefs change as others are introduced, I think it has been beneficial to touch on the logical machinery behind this. There are still plenty of open questions coming from all of this. The one I'd consider is this: how do we know $$ p $$ is truly one of our reasons for believing $$ q $$? Perhaps this would call for a sort of a meta-belief value for $$ B $$ if we suppose $$ p \in B $$ and $$ B \Rightarrow q $$. That is, we *believe* that $$ B $$ is a reason for believing $$ q $$. This rabbit hole is deep, but we might find it important to consider, especially given the knowledge that people tend to be pretty bad at understanding how they themselves think.

We'll use the notation discussed above not as the core of our discussion, but more innocently as a way to structure our discussion without having to call back to lengthy and proprietary terminology. Logic is great for providing structure, but by definition, provides zero content.

### Thinking About Values: An Aside

If you're anything like me, the fact that I have yet to come up with a good definition for "values" might really be bugging you by now. There isn't a very good reason for that other than it's not something I've gotten around to yet. I've typed up something special for those readers to enjoy. I do warn that you probably won't find it very satisfying.

For me, a value in the general sense is a disposition a person has toward a given thing in the world. At the risk of being overly technical, a value can be thought of as a weighted mapping of a belief onto the world. If we wanted to be as formal as we were in the previous section, we might assign a numerical value (not to make a pun) to a value-belief $$ \hat{x} $$, or something along those lines. Maybe this could be generalized for all beliefs, too: there are surely some beliefs that people are more willing to let go of than other beliefs, and maybe we're totally indifferent about some things altogether. We can imagine a negative-neutral-positive scale for this, but I'd prefer not to get ourselves entangled in more formalism.

This is probably not enough of an explanation to satisfy most people, but perhaps it's best to leave it that way. Though values seem to be at the core of this discussion, it might be most beneficial to discover how we ought to describe them as we go along. The results might be surprising.

### Molecules, Your Genes, and You

So if I decide I have (am?) a soul ($$ s^{*} $$), and wish to nurture it because it's going to be around forever, or whatever your reason may be. As we've discussed at length, this suggests $$ s^{*} \in B $$ and $$ B \Rightarrow \hat{x} $$. For illustrative purposes, we'll say $$ \hat{x} $$ is something like the belief that I should be good to myself. We can also say something like $$ B \Rightarrow \hat{y} $$, and $$ \hat{y} $$ we can denote as the same general disposition toward other people.

I then discover Darwin, read some biology textbooks, and get pestered by some strangers on the internet about my beliefs. I start to loosen my grasp on $$ s^{*} $$, leaving me stuck in the existential quagmire that pervades the landscape of freshly-converted monists (or whatever you want to call them). I've now adopted a wholly new ToC, and before we give it a letter with a little $$ ^{*} $$ by it, let's try to decide exactly how we want to describe it.

I'll say this straight from the start: I am not a biologist, let alone a geneticist. My knowledge of evolution and DNA stretches about as far as that of any discerning lay-person. This is not, by any stretch, any sort of attempt to rewrite the literature on biological science. There are plenty of works of philosophy out there that try to do things like this, so I'll opt out of that race for now. That being said, I apologize to the folks who are more knowledgeable about the field of biology for any misuse or misrepresentation of these ideas.[^theologian]

So what of the worldview---the theory of constitution---of the one who accepts evolution? How can we describe it, classify it? It could depend on how much abstraction we're willing to deal with. At the level of the theoretical framework itself, we might describe ourselves as the tips of branches of a tree of evolutionary heritage whose roots exist in the violent landscape of this planet in its infancy.[^outer-space] Dig a little deeper, and perhaps we see ourselves as a complex piece of machinery that is the outcome of years and years of selection of favorable traits and behaviors. Deeper still, and we get the alleles that gave rise to those traits, and one more layer (or more, depending on how you're counting) gives us DNA---the replicator in the flesh. We could argue about how it's not the molecules themselves we should identify with, but the code embedded in them, or something else entirely.

Why stop there? DNA and proteins aren't particularly special in any fundamental way, right? They're composed of the same kinds of stuff that makes up everything else. Doesn't that make me just a particular arrangement of charged particles, of which there are countless others all over the place? And that's not even where the rabbit hole ends. We've still got quarks and gluons and fields and forces to talk about, and some might say that doesn't even scratch the surface.

If we're talking about objects---objects that have characteristics that persist through time and space---it's very easy to get lost in the midst of those layers. This is where the "nothing but"s and "merely"s come into view, and in force. Am I nothing but a machine generated by a code that will stop at nothing to keep replicating itself? Am I merely a collection of traits that wound up being pretty good at surviving to a fertile age? How could I possible live with the fact that my identity is tied so intimately to these cold and unforgiving, yet somehow all-controlling and all-encompassing molecules, alleles, or particles. How could we possibly derive value from the knowledge of what they're made of? A carbon atom is a carbon atom is a carbon atom. We can't nurture it, and there's nothing intrinsic to them that make us want to value them over any other carbon atoms.[^carbon-atoms]

This is where the reductionist can chime in: so it isn't useful to pin our identities to the actual components that make up our bodies, our minds. What must be important, then, is the way in which those components are arranged. Setting aside the existential question of identity in teleportation by destruction and re-composition,[^teleportation] I can surely tie "who I am" to the arrangement of my different parts. What does that look like in the scope of this discussion? It seems to fare a bit better when we try to make a ToC/Value linkage. My particles themselves don't have anything special about them, but I can be pretty certain that their arrangement---the way in which they are scattered about through space and time---is completely unique. It is that uniqueness in myself and others that I can come to establish a set of values that try to service that idea. If uniqueness isn't what we're concerned with, another benefit of embracing the 'arrangement' claim is that the arrangement of atoms in my body includes the arrangement of the neurons in my brain, and my brain is what is actually generating my sense of selfhood, my subjectivity.

Each of these claims can take us down a long, winding path on which we can argue at length about what makes an individual and individual. However, we aren't trying to weigh them them here, nor are we trying to come up with one ourselves. The purpose of this section has been to

## [2] Theories of Emergence

I get a little upset when people use words like "nothing but" and "merely" when they're talking about identities.

## [3] The Self in the Abstract

Identity tied to references. How would shifts in ToCs change humanity at large?

## [4] Value in the Abstract

One of my favorite conclusions to the "Are We Living In A Simulation?" articles I read here and there is the "What difference does it make?" conclusion.

[^people]: Agents/beings/choose your own existential 'Dasein'

[^being]: I.e. the fundamental or emergent processes, particles, machine instructions, or whatever else that constitutes "me."

[^constitution]: I guess this could be used interchangeably with "metaphysics", your metaphysics being your theory of being _qua_ being. I'm shying away from that term for two reasons; the first being that I want to define it among a sort of hierarchy of terms in coming paragraphs, and the second being the fact that I just don't want to have the word "metaphysics" spattered throughout this piece.

[^have-or-are]: A funny little quirk of language that I've always loved is the fact that souls tend to be something that we "have" instead of "are." If I _have_ a soul, then what's the thing that's doing the having? It's particularly odd in this case because it comes from the same kind of person who wants to so closely tie their identity to this thing.

[^prehistoric]: I make this claim at the peril of falling into the trap where I try to make claims about the prehistoric man or the pre-religion man or the prephilosophical man or the infant. My eyes tend to glaze over when I read passages in Locke or whatever that make some bold claims about babies, and I'll try to avoid having the same effect on you, dear reader, at all costs.

[^dualist]: From here on out I will start to use the term "dualist" interchangeably with "a person who believes in a soul" and those with other related worldviews. I could be faulted for being imprecise, but I don't think this cavalier use of terminology really harms my position. This is because I'm simply trying to refer to people of this variety as those who tie their values to their metaphysics at a very intimate level. I'll admit that there probably are dualists that don't take that approach to ethics, but I'm honestly just using the term because it's easy to type.

[^soul-world]: Some people think this is in fact our own world!

[^theseus]: Mind for a moment that we can make predicates of either person on their beliefs: Believes-_a_, Believes-_f_, or whatever. A person who stops believing _a_ no longer has the Believes-_a_ property. What if we replace all of the person's beliefs?

[^mutating-caller]: In programming we might refer to this as _mutating the caller_. More on that later.

[^have-soul]: Have?

[^first-order-logic]: I'm going to misuse (maybe you could be charitable say "redefine" or "adopt") some standard symbols here, but just keep in mind that the system I'm illustrating probably doesn't conform to actual, honest-to-goodness first-order logic---in fact, we'll see that it will only do so if our reasons for believing were strictly logical. I could choose another symbol, but that comes with the risk of being accused of having an inflated sense of how familiar I am with how logic works.

[^entailment]: Logic refresher: $$ A $$ entails $$ b $$ if and only if $$ A $$ guarantees (is a sufficient condition for) $$ b $$ and $$ b $$ is required for (is a necessary condition for) $$ A $$.

[^negation]: Where $$ \neg $$ is logical negation: $$ \neg p $$ is true iff $$ p $$ is false.

[^member-of]: Where $$ \in $$ denotes set membership: $$ a \in S $$ iff $$ a $$ is a member of $$ S $$.

[^set_minus]: Where $$ - $$ denotes set subtraction. $$ A - B $$ winds up being $$ A $$ without all the elements which were also in $$ B $$.

[^empty-set]: If we write that our using our notation we'd get $$ \emptyset \Rightarrow p $$, which looks a lot like theoremhood in normal logic. What does that look like in our system? Is a spontaneous belief possible? Could it denote a "gut feeling?" Not even theorems themselves would take this form in our system, since we typically ask for proof when presented with a theorem. The left side of an expression in which the right side is a theorem would be the proof along with an entire theoretical framework: $$ \Gamma \Rightarrow S $$ where $$ S $$ is some theorem $$ \emptyset \models p $$ and $$ \Gamma $$ is $$ \mu \Rightarrow \pi $$ where $$ \pi $$ is a proof and $$ \mu $$ is pretty much all the mathematics or logic you've learned so far.

[^rules-of-inference]: I'm conflating semantic and syntactical entailment here, but first-order logic is complete and sound, so I always safe making this move. Our new system has no such guarantee.

[^logic-literature]: There isn't a whole lot of research behind this section other than my prior knowledge of logic, for several reasons. I would like to investigate more of this in the future, but for now it will do.

[^worlds]: I'm going to use the pragmatist's move and use what might be considered a cop-out for my conception of 'world,' and that is an etymological reference. By 'world' I mean the sum or product or conjunction or union or whatever of humanity or human affairs---see the first couple of entries for "world" in your favorite dictionary.

[^theologian]: I also apologize to the theologian for the previous sections and their generalizations about souls and dualism. I suppose.

[^outer-space]: Or maybe the primordial soup came from outer space. Or maybe we are outer space.

[^carbon-atoms]: Let's not forget also that some of the individual atoms that are doing important things for your body will no longer be part of that body in a year's time.

[^teleportation]: I.e., if I built a teleportation device that worked by taking note of the position of every atom in my body, destroying my body at the starting point, and rebuilding my body based on that stored information at the end point, would (or could) the entity that appears at the end point be considered the same person? It could be argued that this is relevant to the discussion, but I don't believe it's important.
