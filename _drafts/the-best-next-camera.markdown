I recently purchased and have been using a [Fujifilm X100T](http://www.fujifilm.com/products/digital_cameras/x/fujifilm_x100t/) and now I feel like I should share some thoughts about it, and taking pictures in general.<!-- more --> There are lots of people on the internet singing its praises, so I’m going to try not so much to talk about the camera as talk around the camera, especially considering that it has been listed as “discontinued.” Take this post as thoughts from someone who has been out of the digital camera game for a few years.

If you look at my [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/linkie0) feed, the rhythm of my posts there correlates pretty closely with my access to a good digital camera. There is a lot of film there, to be sure, but I definitely don’t find myself taking photos nearly as much with a film camera these days as I do with a digital one. I love film, but there are several reasons why I don’t take my [Canonet](https://www.flickr.com/photos/linkie0/albums/72157612663765460) out on a daily basis. That may change soon now that I’ve begun a film stockpiling project, but right now there is definitely a lack of pictures in my life.

That lack of pictures has gotten to my head in recent months. While I’ve been focusing hard on [learning to program]({% post_url 2016-06-06-it-takes-a-village-part-1 %}), the itch to get out and take more pictures has gotten more intense. A mix of shop talk with my wedding photographer and feeling bad about only having a cell phone to take pictures with in Belize got me to finally start getting a sense of what’s out there in the camera market.
