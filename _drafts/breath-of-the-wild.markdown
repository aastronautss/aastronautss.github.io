The first Zelda game I played was _Ocarina of Time_.[^actual_first] I don't really have any particular memories of playing the game, but it was definitely the beginning of a sort of lifelong obsession I've had with the franchise. For me, Zelda circumscribes the concept of a video game: its formula constitutes the conceptual framework through which I tend to understand most other games.[^limiting_framework] That framework has been in equal parts subverted and expanded upon with _Breath of the Wild_. Here I hope to describe what that means, as well as give my perspective on the identity of the Zelda franchise.

As I'm starting this bit of writing, I have put 76 hours into _Breath of the Wild_. Judging by how long it takes me to write stuff like this, that number will have increased quite a bit by the time I finish.

The landscape of Hyrule in _Ocarina_ felt endless when I first played it. While the limitations of the technology put fairly heavy constraints on the world (the entire game took place well within a square mile), there was a huge amount of effort that was put into making it feel larger than it actually was. The world was designed in such a way that it felt like enormous swaths of land were being traversed as we played through the game. The near-infinite viewing distance allowed us to see distant, yet-to-be-explored zones (most notably Death Mountain); and the speedy day/night cycle compressed the time scale.

David Foster Wallace is on record as describing _Infinite Jest_ as a sort of lopsided (from the editing process) [Sierpinski triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpinski_triangle) in terms of its structure. I couldn't find a whole lot of commentary from him beyond that remark, but I take it to be a suggestion that the world that emerges from the text takes the form of a fractal (duh). That is, any given piece of this world can be examined at any level of detail, from the broad strokes to the tiny bits. The book's chapters are a series of vignettes, in which we visit and revisit its characters, arcs, and themes in a sort of quasi-logical, but not necessarily chronological, order. There's also a lot of plot that happens beyond the text itself--events that are implied moreso than they are given an explicit account[^implicit_explicit]. They exist in the same way that parts of the Sierpinski triangle (or any other fractal) that we haven't yet visited exist: their structure can be grasped from the rules established in the parts that we have visited.

Zelda games have always shared this characteristic. Part of

[^actual_first]: My first Zelda game was actually probably _Link's Awakening_, since I had a GameBoy long before I had any actual Nintendo consoles, but _Ocarina_ was definitely the first one that I remember distinctly.

[^limiting_framework]: This sounds limiting, and it probably is. I don't play nearly as many games as I used to, so my way of approaching a given game mostly snaps-to-grid based on a small subset of the medium. This is partially due of laziness or a lack of exposure, but I hope as an aside to demonstrate how Zelda can stand on its own as such a framework.

[^implicit_explicit]: Because that's how the terms "implicit" and "explicit" are defined, silly.
