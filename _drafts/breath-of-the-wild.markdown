As I'm starting this bit of writing, I have put XXXX hours into _Breath of the Wild_. Judging by how long it takes me to write stuff like this, that number will have increased quite a bit by the time I finish. Once again, I am enchanted and enthralled by a Zelda game, just as I was as I was growing up. The Zelda series was very important to my childhood--it served as my main pop culture obsession

David Foster Wallace is on record as describing _Infinite Jest_ as a sort of lopsided (from the editing process) [Sierpinski triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpinski_triangle) in terms of its structure. I couldn't find a whole lot of commentary from him beyond that remark, but I take it to be a suggestion that the world that emerges from the text takes the form of a fractal (duh). That is, any given piece of this world can be examined at any level of detail, from the broad strokes to the tiny bits. The book's chapters are a series of vignettes, in which we visit and revisit its characters, arcs, and themes in a sort of quasi-logical, but not necessarily chronological, order. There's also a lot of plot that happens beyond the text itself--events that are implied moreso than they are given an explicit account[^implicit_explicit]. They exist in the same way that parts of the Sierpinski triangle (or any other fractal) that we haven't yet visited exist: their structure can be grasped from the rules established in the parts that we have visited.

Zelda games have always shared this characteristic. Part of

[^implicit_explicit]: Because that's how the terms "implicit" and "explicit" are defined, silly.
