title: "Have Better Arguments: You Are Not a Logic Crusader"
category: philosophy
---

I want you (yes, you) to have better arguments. I am writing a series of articles to help you do this.

Last time I talked about logical fallacies--more specifically, I talked about the idea that keeping an entire catalog of fallacies locked and loaded isn't necessarily the best way to understand now to respond to an argument.

I might be shouting into the void here, but this time I want to address something that has bothered me for a while.
