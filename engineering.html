      What do you get when you cross a photographer, a philosophy nerd, a science lover, a voracious reader, an almost-adequate writer, and a software engineer? You'd probably get someone like me. I have a BA in philosophy from the University of California, Santa Cruz, and a year and a half of experience as a system administrator for a small business, where I maintained an on-premises Windows server and developed internal applications for managing client data.

    <p>
      I have recently taken on the task of learning full-stack web development. Drawing from past experiences in computer science and applying recent interests in logic and critical theory, I hope to bring a unique and diverse perspective to whichever team I find myself a part of.

    <h3>Technical Interests</h3>

    <p>
      My primary tools are Ruby and Rails, but I consider myself tool-agnostic. I am proficient technologies such as Ruby, JavaScript, Python, SQL, HTTP, and REST, and have built projects with frameworks like Rails, Sinatra, Flask, and Backbone, but my grasp of first principles make me very adaptable for any stack. I like robust test suites, and practice good design principles.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am seeking a team in which I can grow and challenge myself, while contributing to projects that make the world a better place.
